I see lots of developers start coding straightforwardly without having any designs or plans before coding it.

If I don’t make any designs and don’t build a website step by step, I would get confused and I would not know what I’m doing, and easily it’ll overwhelm me.

If I read this blog, I’ll know how to make a website step by step without getting any confusion.

Let's build a website step by step.

and the first step is...

## Think about the design

If I want to start coding and I don’t know what I should make or design, I need to think beforehand about the design I want to make.

I should put most of my time into thinking about designs, like:

- What should Navbar look like?
- What should Header look like?
- What should Footer look like?
- and …

```jsx /title/ title="app.jsx"
defineDocumentType(() => ({
  // ...
  fields: {
    title: { type: "string" },
  },
}));
```

```jsx {3}
defineDocumentType(() => ({
  // ...
  fields: {
    title: { type: "string" },
  },
}));
```
