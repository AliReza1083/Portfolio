## Why animated Content?

### Why should I create animated content?

Animated content is something that everyone loves, and it can make lessons easier to learn.

If you are trying to increase engagement on social media, I would recommend creating animated content.

### Why did I start making animated contents?

I have been creating content since the beginning of this year (2023).

When I first uploaded my content, I realized that it would not only increase my engagement but also be appreciated by others.

This is the first content:

I knew that this was indeed going to change everything and be appreciated by most people.

I received lots of encouraging comments, so I decided to continue creating content.

### How did I find +14k audience on Twitter?

I kept sharing content for a month, and my followers increased from 2k to 10k in that time.

### Why me?

I know how to create this kind of content, and if you compare my first and most recent content, you will notice significant changes in design and performance.

## Prerequisite

You don't need to know anything to make this kind of content because I can teach you exactly how to do it.

All you need to have is PowerPoint.

> You must have a **Microsoft 365** subscription or use **PowerPoint 2019** or **PowerPoint 2021**.
