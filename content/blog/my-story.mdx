## Introduction

Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ali Reza, a boy who was born in Iran and has spent his entire life as a migrant.
While I was allowed to study in Iran, I faced the unfortunate circumstance of not being able to complete my education or obtain a legitimate certificate due to my migrant status. This is my story...

## Iran

I spent nine years growing up here. My life was greatâ€”I went to school, joined a kung fu club, and was treated like everyone else. However, my father's experiences were completely different. The way some police treated Afghan people was unimaginable.
Most Afghans are forced to work illegally as laborers to provide food for their families. If the police catch them, they either harass them, send them to jail for working illegally, or deport them back to Afghanistan.

> Afghanistan is a war-torn country where there is no safe place to live. Everyone faces hardships and dreams of leaving for resettlement in another country to find peace. Sadly, this dream remains out of reach.

In Iran, we had to change houses frequently, but eventually, we settled into our own beautiful and spacious home. I am grateful to my father for creating such a peaceful environment for us to continue our education. Our house was located in a bustling area with various shops, including barbershops, restaurants, markets, and even a hospital. It holds many cherished memories from my time in Iran.
Stay with me, and I will share the reasons why I left the country. What happened next will make the story even more captivating :)

### Why I left?

When my father realized that Iran was not an ideal place for the education of an Afghan boy, he made the decision to migrate to another country in search of better educational opportunities. This was the primary reason for my departure, although I am certain there were other factors involved. You may be familiar with the situation in Iran through news reports, so there's no need for me to elaborate here. :(

My goal was to move and settle in a different country, so the next country we visited...

## Afghanistan

It was my first time returning to my home country, as I was born and raised in Iran.

Upon arrival, I noticed the dusty streets and the unpaved road. It's a country with a long history of war and age, so our expectations should be tempered accordingly.

Unfortunately I don't have images to show you ;)

We checked into a hotel and stayed there for two days before moving to the house of one of our relatives. We remained there until we went to

## India

We stayed there for 28 days, and to be honest, I don't remember much from that time. However, one thing I do recall is the excessive use of fireworks during their ceremony. It was a sleepless night, as those were quite possibly the loudest and most disruptive fireworks I have ever experienced in my life. Hahaha, definitely not the best display!

## Singapore

During our transit in Singapore, we stayed there for one day. Unfortunately, we struggled to communicate with people and buy food due to our limited English proficiency.

Luckily, a fellow traveler who was with us showed his passport to a police officer. In that tense moment, my father said, "If the police take us, all you need to do is escape and leave here." Although it was a stressful situation at the time, looking back, it brings laughter to our memories. Hahaha!

## My last days in Indonesia

I was busy with buying staffs and packing them, but I was coding as well because that is my goal so I did not forget it :)

I called most of my friends to my room to be with each other and talk about things.
