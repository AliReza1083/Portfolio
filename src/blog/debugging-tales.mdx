# Debugging Tales

Throughout the past two weeks, I've been learning MDX with Nextjs.

- MDX - allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

- Nextjs - is a React framework that gives you the building blocks to create web applications.

Because it was my first time using MDX, I did not know what MDX was.

So I searched "MDX & Nextjs" on google, and I clicked the first link which was from Nextjs Official website.

I followed all the steps that the documentation instructed me to do, and I thought to myself:

> I did it...Let's goooooo

However, my work was not done yet as I did not know how to style them and make them look visually appealing. Therefore, I searched for a solution and eventually resolved the problem.

Everything was going as planned until I encountered an issue with highlighting the code syntax. I searched for a solution, but I couldn't find a satisfactory answer because everyone was saying something different and I couldn't understand what they meant. As a result, it was a challenging problem for me.

I was pressed for time and needed to learn how to use them for my website. However, the process was becoming overwhelming for me.

I was frustrated because of the errors that I was getting all the time.

## Meeting

I searched everywhere (YouTube, Google) to solve my problem, but I found it difficult to understand the solutions I came across. However, I eventually stumbled upon a repository where they were using MDX and Next.js.

I found their Twitter profile and DMed them to teach me about MDX & Nextjs.

> I do not care who that person is, I just seek knowledge.

We arranged a meeting, and they explained things very well.

During the meeting, I learned

1. How to get the folder's path by using import path from "path"

1. How to read the files using import fs from "fs"

1. How to convert MDX to JSX by using import matter from "gray-matter"

1. and ...

```jsx {1,2} showLineNumbers
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

const pathFiles = path.join(process.cwd(), "blog"); // Folder Path
const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(pathFiles); // All the names of files that exist in a folder.
```

This helped me a lot with getting all the files and rendering them on the page, but still, I was struggling to add `syntax highlighter`, Like the following image:
