## Introduction

My name Ali and it is been 2 years that I have come to the world of web development, to be honest I was not coding through out this 2 years because I was keep stopping it and starting it again and again, So I can say that I am taking this field serious for 1 year and it is fun to make amazing website with lots of amazing animations.

Right now I am in love with `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS` and `Framer-Motion`, I have to say that they are amazing for a real developer to make an amazing website.

Let's stop the Introduction, and begin our main topic which is

# My Twitter Journey

I have start the Twitter on JAN/2022, and I wanted to use it for sharing my projects and journey.

For the first 1/2 months, I was sharing my process and teaching a little bit about what I learnt.

after It was getting boring because My post was not getting likes, So I told myself: "What is the point of sharing on Twitter when no one sees it or even like it?".

I stopped the Twitter for several months, but I started it again because I knew that I have show my skills to the world in order to have high possibility to get a great job.

Just like most of the developers, I was sharing all projects I made and most of importantly I was joining twitter spaces to increase my confidence because I was a little bit shy but Thanks god Right now I feel a lot better now.

## My Real Journey begins...

When 2023 just started, I say someone on Twitter that made animated content (just like I am making now), that really inspired me to make those kinds of contents and I am sure everyone would like see such contents.

first, I did not how to make such content but I knew something about PowerPoint, but I thought that PowerPoint is just for presentation, not for making videos.

I was carious If I be able to export as video or not, So I searched on YouTube (How to export as video in PowerPoint?).

With the help of a video, I finally learnt it and start making animated contents with PowerPoint since Jan.

This is my first content that went viral:

When I saw that most of the people is loving such contents, I kept making them and sharing so that people could learn something very easily.
