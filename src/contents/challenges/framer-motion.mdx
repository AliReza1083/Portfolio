# Mastering Framer Motion

I really like to learn new things from others, especially when it comes to animation, I have to learn it. I don't care how much the course costs, I will buy it any way.

> recently I bought two courses which cost over $100; both courses will teach me how to animate with SVG or a simple element. :)

You might saw some of my works that I mainly used `framer-motion` to animate things. before starting the challenge, I did not know too much about framer motion; I thought I know it but while making amazing projects in this challenge, I found out that there are so many things that we have to know to improve our skills.

Let me take you to very first day that I joined a course that changed my animation skills.

I am working for a client. the website needed a few animations that I had to build. They sent me the following message:

Now you know how much I love to learn things, that is why I pay for courses.

These are some of my works:

The course is from [Emil Kowalski](https://x.com/emilkowalski_), the course is so amazing that I am willing to help others in his community which he just started it. :)

You can follow me on my new X page where I will share my works: [@alisamadi\_\_](https://x.com/alisamadi__); You can also check the source code [here](https://github.com/AliReza1083/Portfolio/tree/main/app/talent/designs/50-day-challenge).
